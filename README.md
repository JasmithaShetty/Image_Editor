This is a Simple Image editor using Pillow(PIL) Library in Python.
This helps us to edit our images as required.
So in this project I have been used contrast, enhance, blur, black and white etc.,
**Note:** I have main.py and mainother.py. Here we make use of main.py.
Basically the mainother.py is not being used it's just an basic idea of how an image editing application looks like.
So whenever you are running just run only the main.py.
Also You can use any pictures instead of tulips.jpg with any extension such as png, jpeg.
The output can be in any form with the any names.
Also you can give any numbers for editing such as the contrast number or the enhanced number.
